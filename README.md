## 🌌 Why Tech?

To be honest, I didn’t start with a clear purpose for choosing tech. But along the way, I discovered that **technology is full of excitement and challenges** — it pushes boundaries, solves real problems, and enhances what humans are capable of.

Ironically, even though we say tech can do what humans can’t, **we're the ones who built it** — so maybe we're more capable than we think.

What truly inspires me?  
> *The stars, the cosmos, the idea of exploring the universe.*

I believe that with technology, one day humanity can become a **multi-planetary race**.  
And when that time comes, **I want to be part of the journey**.

With my current skills, I may not be capable of doing that **yet** —  
but let’s **keep the dream alive for the future me** 🚀
